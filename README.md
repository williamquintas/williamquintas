# William Quintas — Software Engineer

I started my career building features. I stayed because I enjoy **solving messy, real problems with software** — and helping other engineers do the same.

Over the years, my focus naturally shifted from *“how to implement”* to *“what should be built, why, and how it scales”*.

## What I work on today

I design and build **full-stack systems used in production**, balancing delivery speed with long-term maintainability. My work typically involves:
- Designing APIs and distributed systems
- Making architectural trade-offs under real constraints
- Owning features end-to-end (design → code → deploy → operate)
- Mentoring engineers and raising code quality across the team

Most of my experience comes from **high-impact, real products**, not toy projects — mobile apps, web platforms, and internal systems used globally.

## Problems I’ve helped solve

- Scaling applications used by multiple regions with different requirements  
- Integrating asynchronous systems (queues, background jobs, APIs) without increasing operational complexity  
- Improving reliability and delivery speed through CI/CD and clearer architecture boundaries  
- Turning vague product requirements into concrete, testable technical solutions  
- Onboarding and mentoring engineers to become autonomous contributors faster  

## How this GitHub reflects my journey

This profile is intentionally **curated**:
- Fewer repositories, focused on **depth over volume**
- Projects that demonstrate **system thinking**, not just syntax
- Clear documentation explaining *decisions*, not only implementations

Some repositories explore advanced topics (e.g., simulation, optimization, reinforcement learning) because they sharpen how I reason about complex systems — a skill that directly translates to large-scale software design.
